date: 2018-02-25
---

Speed-run of some shallow algorithms: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN); K-means; Apriori; PCA; Decision Trees

## Episode

KNN (supervised)

- Unsupervised / Clustering -> K-Means

- Association rule learning / Market basket -> Apriori - Dimensionality Reduction -> PCA Decision Trees (supervised, classify/regress)

- Random Forests

- Gradient Boost
